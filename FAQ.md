## What do I need to test FADI?

* a minimal setup can run on your laptop using minikube (see [the local deployment](https://github.com/cetic/fadi#02-local-deployment). Currently 16GB RAM with a modern CPU should be sufficient.
* if you have an account at a public cloud that provides Kubernetes as a service (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...), or have a Kubernetes cluster at hand, you can install the stack using our Helm template. (see [GKE instructions](https://github.com/cetic/fadi#04-deployment-on-gke))
